<p>Hello <%= @personname %>!</p>
<p>My name is Ricardo Piro-Rael, and I’m your peer tutor for Web Application Architectures with Greg Heileman, offered by the University of New Mexico through Coursera.</p>

<p>This is a reminder that all the quizzes in module 3 are due on Monday, September 15.</p>

<p>Even though the soft deadline has passed you will still receive full credit as long as you submit the quiz before the hard deadline.</p>

<p>You can access academic support services at <%= link_to "Our Google+ Page", "https://plus.google.com/109670650612181096770/" %>. On this page, I’ll post resources that I think will be useful to you in meeting your goal to complete the course, I’ll reply to any issues with the content or assignments that seem to be emerging on the discussion boards, and I’ll hold regular study sessions.</p>

<p>You can also contact me directly with any issues you are having in the course, at <%= mail_to "webappmooc@gmail.com" %>.</p>

<p>Thank you very much, and I look forward to seeing you in our group!</p>
